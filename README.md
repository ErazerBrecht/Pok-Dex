# PokéDex
PokéDex made with WPF using Databinding

Made use of Poke.API and Bulbapedia (webscraping)!

#Data
I use the PokaAPI for most of the data.
Little problem is that the description doesn't match the correct generation
This will be fixed in version 2 of the PokeAPI
https://github.com/phalt/pokeapi/issues/34

When version two is released i will update this project!

#Features
- Pokedex information: Name, type, Description, Specie, Height, Weight, Catch Rate and Sex ratio
- Base stats of Pokémon
- Abilities (this one is not finished yet)
- Sound (Cry of the Pokémon)
- Leveling moves (with information Type, Power, Accuracy and  default PP)
- TM/HM moves (also with information)
- Speed as an image (Shuckle = Slow, Kirlia = Normal, Pickachu = Fast)
- Evolutions of the Pokémon (with level!)
- Search on name
- Filter on type
- Order on stats (ASC or DESC)
- Choose of generation (This changes the moves/description/... @ the moment only GEN1,2 and 3 works)

#Education
This was a project to learn how to databind.
I also added: 3 Layer Model (.NET Class Library), IValueConvertor, LinQ, Mahapps ...
